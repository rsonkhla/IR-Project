==Name origiwikibn==
In 1798, The Holland Land Company hired Theophile Cazenove of Philadelphia as its agent in the newly established hub for the area in nearby Batavia, NY.  Cazenove then hired Joseph Ellicott, to survey the area and establish a village next to Buffalo Creek. Ellicott decided to utilize the spoke pattern for his new village, which he called "New Amsterdam", and centered it around Niagara Square.  In 1800, residents of the small village decided they did not like the name "New Amsterdam" and decided it would be called "Buffalo".  In 1808, the name was officially changed and the Village of Buffalo had 25 residents at the time.

Most popular accounts hold that the name "Buffalo" is a corruption of the French phrase ''beau fleuve,'' "beautiful river," a phrase said to have been exclaimed by French explorers upon seeing the [[Niagara River]]. This speculation, however, is contradicted by primary sources. French explorers actually referred to Buffalo Creek in print as ''Rivière aux Chevaux,'' "Horse River."<ref>Houghton, Frederick. The Name Buffalo. Buffalo, NY: Buffalo Historical Society Publications, v. 24, pp. 63–69 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fY4MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=Buffalo+first+appeared+on+a+map&source=web&ots=Dg-YQZb0Ur&sig=MOPlDcMG_xdKlwbd_3RzF0wjM_U&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPR3,M1 Books.google.com]</ref> The earliest name origin theory to appear in print (1825) relates a story about stolen horsemeat being passed off as bison flesh, with the site of the illicit picnic henceforth remembered as "Buffalo," but the author who conveyed this tale expressed his skepticism.<ref>Ball, Sheldon.

Prior to the [[Iroquois]] occupation of the region, the region was settled by the [[Neutral Nation]]. Later, the Senecas of the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy conquered the Neutrals. In 1804, [[Joseph Ellicott]], a principal agent of the [[Holland Land Company]], designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes,<ref>{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr.|first = J. Henry |title = Beginnings&nbsp;—The Village of Buffalo - 1801 to 1832 |url = http://history.buffalonet.org/1801.html |accessdate = 2007-09-07}}</ref> and is one of the few radial street plans in the US.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} During the [[War of 1812]], on December 30, 1813,<ref>[http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html The Buffalonian]</ref>{{'}}<ref>[http://www.buffaloah.com/h/war1812/burning.html History of Buffalo]</ref> Buffalo was burned by British forces. On November 4, 1825 the [[Erie Canal]] was completed with Buffalo strategically positioned at the western end of the system. At the time, the population was about 2,400. The Erie Canal brought a surge in population and commerce which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832, with a population of about 10,000 people.

The City of Buffalo has long been home to African-Americans. An example is the 1828 village directory which listed 59 "Names of Coloured" heads of families.<ref>{{cite web |last = Fordham |first = Monroe |title = Michigan Street Church |work = African American history of Western New York |month = April | year = 1996 |url = http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/hwny-michigan.st.church.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> In 1845, construction was begun on the [[Macedonia Baptist Church (Buffalo, New York)|Macedonia Baptist Church]] (commonly called the ''Michigan Street Baptist Church''). This African-American church was an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. On February 12, 1974 the church was added to the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Erie County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. Abolitionist leaders such as [[William Wells Brown]] made their home in Buffalo.<ref>{{cite web |title= African American history of Western New York |url= http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/wwb0.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> Buffalo was also a terminus point of the [[Underground Railroad]]<ref>{{cite web |title= Underground Railroad Sites in Buffalo, NY |url=http://www.buffaloresearch.com/ugrr.html |accessdate = 2010-07-25}}</ref> with many fugitives crossing the [[Niagara River]] from Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] and freedom.

During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo.<ref name="The City of Buffalo 1840-1850" >{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr. |first = J. Henry |title= The City of Buffalo 1840–1850 |url = http://history.buffalonet.org/1840-50.html |accessdate = 2007-09-09}}</ref> Grain and commercial goods shipments led to repeated expansion of the harbor. In 1843, the world's first steam-powered [[grain elevator]] was constructed by local merchant Joseph Dart, Jr. and engineer Robert Dunbar. The "Dart Elevator" enabled faster unloading of [[lake freighter]]s along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from lakers to canal boats and, later on, rail cars.<ref name = "The City of Buffalo 1840-1850"/>

Abraham Lincoln visited Buffalo on February 16, 1861 on his trip to accept the presidency of the United States. During his visit, he stayed at the American Hotel on Main Street between Eagle Street and Court Street.<ref name = "The History of Buffalo: A Chronology Buffalo, New York 1841-1865">{{cite web |last =LaChiusa |first = Chuck |title = The History of Buffalo: A Chronology Buffalo, New York 1841–1865 |url = http://freenet.buffalo.edu/bah/h/1865.html#1859 |accessdate = 2007-09-08}} {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> The Civil War years saw an increase in the population of Buffalo which grew from 81,029 to 94,210 by 1865. In addition to sending many soldiers to the Union effort, Buffalo manufacturers supplied important war material. For example, the Niagara Steam Forge Works manufactured turret parts for the [[ironclad]] ship [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']].<ref name = "The History of Buffalo: A Chronology Buffalo, New York 1841-1865" />

[[Grover Cleveland]] served as Sheriff of Erie County (1871–1873), and was Mayor of Buffalo in 1882. He was later [[Governor of New York]] (1883–1885), 22nd President of the United States (1885–1889) and 24th President (1893–1897).

In May, 1896, the [[Ellicott Square Building]] opened. For the next 16 years, it was the largest office building in the world. It was named after the surveyor Joseph Ellicott.

At the dawn of the 20th Century, local mills were among the first to benefit from [[hydroelectric power]] generated via the Niagara River. The city got the nickname ''City of Light'' at this time due to the widespread electric lighting.<ref name="cityjournal">[http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_4_buffalo_ny.html Can Buffalo Ever Come Back?] from ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''</ref> In 1881, Buffalo deployed the first electric street lights in the United States. It was also part of the [[automobile]] revolution, hosting the [[brass era]] car builders [[Pierce Arrow]] and the [[Seven Little Buffaloes (automobile company)|Seven Little Buffaloes]] early in the century.<ref>Believe it, or not.

President [[William McKinley]] was [[William McKinley assassination|shot and mortally wounded]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. He died in the city eight days later and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was sworn in at the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Wilcox Mansion]] as the 26th President of the United States.

An international bridge, known as the [[Peace Bridge]], linking Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] was opened in 1927. The [[Buffalo Central Terminal]], a 17-story [[Art Deco]] style station designed by architects [[Fellheimer & Wagner]] for the [[New York Central Railroad]], was finished just weeks before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].

During [[World War II]], Buffalo saw a period of prosperity and low unemployment due to its position as a manufacturing center.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = 1941–1945| work = History| publisher =Parkside Community Association| date =| url = http://www.parksidebuffalo.org/history.html| doi =| accessdate = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

With the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1957, which cut the city off from valuable trade routes; [[deindustrialization]]; and the nation-wide trend of [[suburbanization]]; the city's economy began to deteriorate. Like much of the [[Rust Belt]], Buffalo, which peaked at more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline by almost 50 percent as industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities.

Like other [[rust belt]] cities such as [[Flint, Michigan]], Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. $4 billion was spent in 2007 compared to a $50 million average for the previous ten years.<ref>{{cite web |title= current city development projects 2007|url= http://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/files/1_2_1/splanning/listofprojects/ListBuffDev101007.pdf |accessdate = 2007-11-04|format=PDF}}</ref> New proposals and renovations are numerous, especially in the downtown core. As of 2008, the population has continued to decrease, despite the efforts of city officials. (See demographics section.)

The economy today is stable and the city's prosperity has increased significantly in the 21st century with the opening of several new hotels catering to tourists visiting nearby [[Niagara Falls]] and a new entertainment district along Elmwood Avenue, along with the opening of factories manufacturing environmentally conscious products.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:BuffaloAvgTemps.png|right|thumb|Buffalo average temperatures]]

===Geography===
Buffalo is located on the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], opposite [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] in Canada, and at the beginning of the [[Niagara River]], which flows northward over [[Niagara Falls]] and into [[Lake Ontario]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|52.5|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|40.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|11.9|sqmi|km2}} of it is water. The total area is 22.66% water.

===Climate===
[[File:BuffInBloom.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo in bloom]]
[[File:Blizzard of 1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blizzard of 1977]]]]
Buffalo has a reputation for snowy winters, but it is rarely the snowiest city in New York State.<ref>[http://goldensnowball.com/2009/01/syracuse-already-over-annul-snowfall.html New York State Golden Snowball Awards.]</ref> The region experiences a fairly humid, [[humid continental climate|continental-type]] climate, but with a definite [[maritime climate|maritime]] flavor due to strong modification from the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] "Dfb"&nbsp;— uniform precipitation distribution). The transitional seasons are very brief in Buffalo and Western New York.

Winters in Western New York are generally cold and [[snowstorm|snowy]], but are changeable and include frequent thaws and rain as well. Winters can also be quite long in Western New York, usually spanning from mid-November to mid-March. Snow covers the ground more often than not from late December into early March, but periods of bare ground are not uncommon. Over half of the annual snowfall comes from the [[lake effect snow|lake effect]] process and is very localized. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air crosses the relatively warm lake waters and becomes saturated, creating clouds and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] downwind. Due to the prevailing winds, areas south of Buffalo receive much more lake effect snow than locations to the north. The lake snow machine starts as early as mid-November, peaks in December, then virtually shuts down after [[Lake Erie]] freezes in mid-to-late January. The most well-known snowstorm in Buffalo's history, the [[Blizzard of 1977|Blizzard of '77]], was not a lake effect snowstorm in Buffalo in the normal sense of that term (Lake Erie was frozen over at the time), but instead resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated both on land and on frozen Lake Erie. Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage as with the [[Lake Storm "Aphid"|October 2006 storm]].

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], but still has enough rain to keep [[vegetation]] green and lush.<ref>[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/buf/bufclifo.htm Buffalo's Climate]. ''National Weather Service''. Retrieved July 5, 2006.</ref> Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate [[humidity]] and temperature. It receives, on average, over 65% of possible sunshine in June, July and August. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact that Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off [[Lake Erie]] in summer that gently temper the warmest days. As a result, the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of {{convert|100|F|1|abbr=on}} or more.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USNY0181?from=tenDay_bottomnav_undeclared Weather.com. Record high of {{convert|99|°F|0|abbr=on}} was recorded in August 1948]</ref> Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs at night. The stabilizing effect of [[Lake Erie]] continues to inhibit [[thunderstorms]] and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July. August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence.

===City proper===
Like most formerly industrial cities of the Great Lakes region, Buffalo has experienced an economic depression brought about by the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States and its population has declined in every year since. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, is significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population is equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change.

Although the trend is inconclusive at this time, current census estimates indicate the rate of population loss may be decelerating to a stable state. The 2008–2009 loss estimate is 50% less than the years prior, and is at less than 1% year-over-year loss. Whether this trend will continue will not be evident until next year's estimate.

At the 2005–2007 American Community Survey Estimates, the city's population was 53.8% White (48.7% non-Hispanic White alone), 41.1% Black or African American, 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.0% Asian, 4.5% from some other race and 2.5% from two or more races. 8.3% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-context=adp&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_DP3YR5&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_&-tree_id=3307&-redoLog=true&-_caller=geoselect&-geo_id=16000US3611000&-format=&-_lang=en Census Bureau]</ref>

At that time of the 2000 census there were 292,648 people, 122,720 [[households]], and 67,005 [[family|families]] residing in the city. The [[population density]] is 7,205.8 people per square mile (2,782.4/km²). There are 145,574 [[house|housing]] units at an average density of 3,584.4 per square mile (1,384.1/km²). The [[Race (U.S. Census)|racial]] makeup of the city is 54.43% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 37.23% [[African American]], 0.77% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.40% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.68% from other races, and 2.45% from two or more races. 7.54% of the population are [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] of any race. The top 5 largest ancestries include [[German American|German]] (13.6%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (12.2%), [[Italian American|Italian]] (11.7%), [[Polish American|Polish]] (11.7%), and [[English American|English]] (4.0%).<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/city/Buffalo-New-York.html Buffalo, New York (NY) Detailed Profile - relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders]</ref>

There were 122,720 households out of which 28.6% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.6% are married couples living together, 22.3% have a female householder with no husband present, and 45.4% are non-families. 37.7% of all households are made up of individuals and 12.1% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.29 and the average family size is 3.07.

In the city the population included 26.3% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 34 years. For every 100 females there are 88.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 83.5 males.

The [[median household income|median income]] for a household in the city is $24,536, and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the [[poverty line]]. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

[[File:Buffalo NY historical population.png|left|thumb|Population of Buffalo, 1830–2006]]

Buffalo has very sizable populations of [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Polish American|Polish]], [[German American|German]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], [[Greek American|Greek]], [[Arab American|Arab]], [[African American]], [[Indian American|Indian]], and [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] descent. Major ethnic neighborhoods still exist but they changed significantly in the second half of the 20th century. Traditionally, [[Polish-Americans]] were the predominant occupants of the [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]], while [[Italian-Americans]] composed a close-knit neighborhood in the west side. The [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]] is now a predominantly African American neighborhood, while the West Side has become a [[melting pot]] of many ethnicities, with [[Latino]] culture being the strongest influence. Throughout the history of Buffalo, the neighborhoods collectively called the First Ward, as well as much of [[South Buffalo]], have comprised almost entirely people of [[Irish descent]]. Recently, there has been an influx of inhabitants that are of Arab descent, mainly from [[Yemen]], as the city's [[Muslim]] population has increased to approximately 3000 according to an estimate.<ref>http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim/LocalMosques.htm {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Since the 1950s and 1960s, the greater portion of the Jewish population has moved to the [[suburban]] areas outside of the city, or to the city's upper West Side.

==Economy==
[[File:20080310 Soldiers and Sailors edit.JPG|thumb|right|Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, [[Lafayette Square, Buffalo|Lafayette Square]]]]

===History===
Buffalo and the surrounding area were long involved in railroad commerce, [[steel]] manufacture, [[automobile]] production, aircraft/aerospace design and production, Great Lakes shipping, and grain storage. Most of these industries have left the city through the years. Major steel production no longer exists in the area, although several smaller steel mills remain in operation. For example, Gibraltar Industries, a leading manufacturer, processor, and distributor of steel products for the building, industrial, and vehicular markets is headquartered in Buffalo. As of the [[1950 United States Census]], Buffalo was the 15th largest city in the country, the nation's largest inland port (twelfth overall), second biggest rail center, sixth largest steel producer, and eighth largest manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Greater Look At Greater Buffalo|page=58|publisher=Windsor Publications|isbn=978-0-89781-198-9|year=1986|author=Bisco, Jim}}</ref>

The regional economy can now best be described as a mix of industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and service-oriented private sector companies. Instead of relying on a single industry or sector for its economic future, the region has taken a diversified approach that have the potential to create opportunities for growth and expansion in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rkn.buffalo.edu/reports/region_quick_results.cfm?type=4 |title= Binational Buffalo Niagara Region Report |author= University at Buffalo Regional Institute|publisher= UB Regional Institute|year=2011 |work=Regional Knowledge Network |accessdate=2 February 2011 }}</ref>

===Race===

On October 25, 2008 the United Nations released a report entitled "State of the World's Cities" in which the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area was specifically cited as having one of the worst rates of economic inequality in the world and that it was racially based. The report specifically stated "the report cited figures from western New York state, where 40 per cent of black, Hispanic and ethnically-mixed households earned less than $15,000 in 1999, as compared to 15 per cent of white households." <ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2008/10/2008102321493551343.html UN: Major inequality in US cities - Americas - Al Jazeera English]</ref> In addition, the United States Census department also released information placing the Buffalo-Niagara metro area, as the 8th most segregated area in America.<ref>[http://www.censusscope.org/us/rank_dissimilarity_white_black.html CensusScope - Segregation: Dissimilarity Indices]</ref>

===Employment===
Overall, employment in Buffalo has shifted as its population has declined and manufacturing has left. Buffalo's 2005 unemployment rate was 6.6%, contrasted with New York State's 5.0% rate.<ref>[http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/wny/WesternSlideShows.asp See Erie County]</ref> And from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006, Erie County had no net job growth, ranking it 271st among the 326 largest counties in the country.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cewqtr.t01.htm BLS, Table 1. Covered establishments, employment, and wages in the 326 largest counties, fourth quarter 2006]</ref> Yet the area has recently seen an upswing in job growth as unemployment has dropped to only 4.9% in July 2007 from 5.2% in 2006 and 6.6% in 2005.<ref>[http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/PressReleases/prtbur.txt New York]</ref> The area's manufacturing jobs have continued to show the largest losses in jobs with over 17,000 fewer than at the start of 2006. Yet other sectors of the economy have outdistanced manufacturing and are seeing large increases. Educational and health services added over 30,400 jobs in 2006 and over 20,500 jobs have been added in the professional and business (mostly finance) arena.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/ ''bizjournals.com'']</ref>

===Life sciences===
Buffalo has increasingly become a center for [[bioinformatics]] and [[human genome]] research, including work by researchers at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] and the [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]]. This consortium is known as the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]]. It also includes: Buffalo Hearing & Speech Center, Buffalo Medical Group Foundation, [[Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute]], Kaleida Health, Olmsted Center for the Visually Impaired, Cleveland BioLabs and Upstate New York Transplant Services. The DNA samples used in The Human Genome Project were also collected from anonymous donors from Buffalo.

Entrepreneurial resources and life science business consultants accelerate the growth and development of emerging companies found within the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]] and Upstate New York Region. For example, Buffalo BioSciences is a technology commercialization partner to the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Life Sciences and contributed to the launch and early success of Empire Genomics&nbsp;–- a firm based on research conducted at Roswell Park Cancer Institute by Dr. Norma Nowak enabling {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the delivery of personalized medicine.

===Banking===
Buffalo is the headquarters of [[M&T Bank]], a large regional bank with assets over $79B (as of June 2011).<ref>https://www.mtb.com/aboutus/Pages/WhoIsMT.aspx</ref> [[HSBC Bank USA]] also has major operations in Buffalo (The sports arena, which hosts the [[Buffalo Sabres]] [[National Hockey League|NHL]] franchise, is named [[HSBC Arena (Buffalo)|HSBC Arena]]). Other banks, such as [[Bank of America]] and [[KeyBank]] have corporate operations in Buffalo. [[Citigroup]] also has regional offices in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], Buffalo's largest suburb. Buffalo has also become a hub of the debt collection industry.<ref>{{cite news| last = Thompson | first = Carolyn | authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo's debt collectors accused of bullying =| agency = Associated Press| date = 2010-01-05| url = http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Buffalos-debt-collectors-apf-2226423347.html?x=0| doi =| accessdate = 2010-01-05}}</ref>

[[First Niagara Bank]] recently moved its headquarters to downtown Buffalo from nearby [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]]. First Niagara has branches from Buffalo to [[Albany, New York]], and since September 2009 has had branches as far south as [[Pittsburgh]]. On September 10, 2009, First Niagara announced the relocation of its corporate headquarters from Lockport to downtown Buffalo. The company says facilities in Lockport will remain open and fully staffed.<ref>[https://www.fnfg.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=847 First Niagara © 2009]</ref> First Niagara, which had been considering expanding into [[Western Pennsylvania]] for some time,<ref name=PNC>[http://kdka.com/business/PNC.First.Niagara.2.978660.html KDKA-TV] {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> benefited from [[PNC Financial Services]] being required by the [[United States Department of Justice]] to sell off 50 [[National City Corp.|National City]] branches in the [[Pittsburgh]] area and 11 more branches in and around [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] to competitors,<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/branches-divested.pdf United States Department of Justice]</ref> since the two banks had significant overlap in [[Western Pennsylvania]] and had potential [[antitrust]] issues in that area. First Niagara took advantage by buying 57 of the 61 National City branches from PNC that had to be divested after PNC acquired National City with funds from the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|$700 billion bailout plan]] after National City became a victim of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. The move affected the area by creating 200 more jobs, some in the Buffalo area.<ref>[http://www.fnfg.com/pdf/pressRelease_04072009.pdf First Niagara © 2009]</ref> On July 31, 2011, it was announced First Niagara had acquired all of HSBC Banks Western New York branches.

==Largest private sector employers in Western New York==
The Buffalo Niagara Enterprise (BNE), "a nonprofit, private business development and regional marketing organization" has released a table containing the largest Private sector employers for Western New York - 2011.<ref>The list can be found on the BNE website [http://www.buffaloniagara.org/files/content/Research/DataPoints/TopBizOneSheet-01_21_11.pdf here]. This information is obtained from the Business First 2011 Book of Lists.</ref>

[[File:Buffalo City Hall - 001.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo's [[Art Deco]] [[Buffalo City Hall|city hall]]]]
{{See also|List of mayors of Buffalo, New York}}

At the [[City (New York)|municipal]] level, the City of Buffalo has a council made up of the [[mayor]] and nine [[city council|councilmen]]. Buffalo also serves as the seat of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with 6 of the 15 county legislators representing at least a portion of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three state [[New York State Assembly|assemblymen]] and two state [[New York State Senate|senators]] representing parts of the city proper. At the federal level, Buffalo is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

In a trend common to Northern "[[Rust Belt]]" regions, political life in Buffalo has been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for the last half-century, and has been roiled by racial division and social issues. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was 1965 [Chester A. Kowal}.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Kowal]</ref> In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was first elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiance several times during his 14 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on [[social conservatism]], often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%-27%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform.

This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. At the urging of [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]], the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the [[Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority]]. Conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government were initiated the following year by Mayor Tony Masiello, but came to naught.

===Neighborhoods===
Buffalo consists of 32 different neighborhoods: ([http://library.buffalo.edu/maps/buffalo-wnymaps/buffalo_neighborhoods.php A map and listing of the neighborhoods from the University at Buffalo]) [[Allentown, Buffalo, New York|Allentown]], Bailey-Lovejoy, [[Black Rock, Buffalo, New York|Black Rock]], Central Park, Clinton-Bailey, Cold Springs, [[Delaware District, Buffalo, New York|Delaware District]], [http://www.buffaloplace.com/ Downtown], [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]], [http://www.foreverelmwood.org/ Elmwood Village], Fillmore-Leroy, First Ward, Fruit Belt, Hamlin Park, Hospital Hill, Humboldt Park, Kaisertown, Kensington, Kensington Heights, Lower West Side, Masten Park, [[North Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|North Buffalo]], North Park, [http://www.parksidebuffalo.org/ Parkside], [http://www.broadwayfillmorealive.org/ Polonia/Broadway Fillmore], [[Riverside, Buffalo, New York|Riverside]], Schiller Park, [[South Buffalo]],University District, [[University Heights, Buffalo, New York|University Heights]], Vernon Triangle, [[Upper West Side, Buffalo, New York|Upper West Side]], and Willert Park.

There are currently 9 [http://www.city-buffalo.com/Home/Leadership/CommonCouncil common council districts] in The City of Buffalo. They are: Delaware, Ellicott, Fillmore, Lovejoy, Masten, Niagara, North, South, and University.

===Parks===
{{Main|Buffalo, New York parks system}}
[[File:Buffalo Botanical Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens]]]]

One of Buffalo's many monikers is the ''City of Trees'', which describes the abundance of green in the city. In fact, Buffalo has more than 20 parks with multiple ones being accessible from any part of the city.

The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Begun in 1868 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his partner [[Calvert Vaux]], the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and are maintained by the [http://www.buffaloolmstedparks.org/ Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy].

===Waterfront===
[[File:Buffalo New York aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of the waterfront at Buffalo, New York. The city is to the north. The highway to the right is [[New York State Route 5]]]]
Situated at the confluence of [[Lake Erie]] and the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo]] and [[Niagara River]]s, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of [[transshipment]], [[manufacturing]], and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade, and industry.

As of 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront is being transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. Recently excavated and rewatered is the Erie Canal Commercial Slip, which is the original western terminus of the Erie Canal System. This is intended to revitalize the original Erie Canal Harbor, with shops, eateries,and high-rise condominiums planned. Buffalo's intent is to stress its relatively architectural and historical heritage, creating a tourism destination.

===Standard of living===
The loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization and high costs of labor have led to economic decline, making Buffalo one of the poorest amongst U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. An estimated 28.7-29.9% of Buffalo residents live below the [[poverty line]], behind either only [[Detroit]],<ref>http://www.usccb.org/cchd/povertyusa/povfact6.shtml</ref> or only Detroit and [[Cleveland]].<ref>[http://www.wgrz.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=60244&catid=37 Buffalo 3rd Poorest Large City].

This, in part, has led to the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area]] having the most affordable housing market in the U.S. today. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted that nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's median income of $57,000. The area median price of homes was $75,000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Buffalo faces issues with vacant and abandoned houses, as the city ranks second only to [[St. Louis]] on the list of American cities with the most vacant properties per capita. Since 2000, the city has torn down 2,000 vacant homes but as many as 10,000 still remain. Mayor Byron W. Brown recently unveiled a $100 million, five-year plan to demolish 5,000 more houses.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/nyregion/13vacant.html?_r=1&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Belson,%20Ken&oref=slogin Vacant Houses, Scourge of a Beaten-down Buffalo].

==Culture==
===Nicknames===
"The Queen City", Buffalo's most common moniker, first appeared in print in the 1840s, referring to the city's status as the second largest city in New York State after New York City. "The Queen City" was also used during the 19th century to describe Buffalo as the second largest American city on the [[Great Lakes]] after [[Chicago]]. Buffalo has also been called ''The Nickel City'' due to the appearance of a bison on the back of [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|Indian Head nickel]] in the early part of the 20th century. ''The City of Good Neighbors'' refers to the helpful, friendly spirit of its inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo Widely Knows as 'City of Good Neighbors'| newspaper = Washington Afro-American| location =| page = 20| publisher =| date = August 14, 1951| url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&dat=19510814&id=CjsmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rv4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4955,329648| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}</ref> In the early 20th century, the city began calling itself the ''City of Light'' both because of the plentiful hydroelectric power made possible by nearby [[Niagara Falls]] and because it was the first city in America to have electric street lights.<ref name="cityjournal"/>

===People===
Buffalo was first settled primarily by [[New England]]ers. The first wave of European immigrants was a large influx of [[German American|Germans]]. The city was further populated by [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants first, Erie Canal builders and then escaping [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|famine]], and infused by [[Polish American|Polish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], and more recently [[Latino]] populations, all of which have made it a [[melting pot]] of ethnic cultures. The newest immigrants are from [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Asia]].

The Old First Ward retains a strong Irish identity, and Kaisertown reflects a German heritage. Buffalo's [[Polonia]] is centered at the Broadway Market on the East Side. The market serves as a microcosm of Polish/Slavic traditions and delicacies.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The History of the Broadway Market| work =| publisher = The Broadway Market| year = 2009| url = http://broadwaymarket.org/?page_id=2| format =| doi =| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}</ref> The East Side is now home to African Americans, many of whom came north during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. The annual [[Juneteenth]] Festival is a large cultural celebration organized by African Americans<ref>[http://www.juneteenthofbuffalo.com/ Juneteenth Festival of Buffalo, NY]. Retrieved 7 July 2007.</ref> in [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Park.

The West Side is home to the city's [[Hispanic]] community, predominantly of Puerto Rican descent. The West Side was once Buffalo's "Little Italy," but in the 1980s much of Buffalo's Italian American community moved to North Buffalo. There is also a small Italian-American enclave in the East Side neighborhood of Lovejoy. Many Buffalo households, churches, and restaurants continue to observe the Sicilian custom of preparing [[St. Joseph's Day]] (March 19) tables, at which various meatless [[Lent]]en courses are laid out for the poor.

Buffalo is also home to a large [[American Jews|Jewish]] community. [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] immigrants originally settled on Buffalo's Westside in the mid-19th century. Lower income [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] immigrating to the [[Niagara Frontier]] in the early 20th century initially settled on the Lower East Side, near William Street and Jefferson Avenue. The community migrated to the Masten Park neighborhood on the East Side, and then to [[North Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|North Buffalo]] between the 1940s and the 1960s. Although many still live in the city, particularly in North Buffalo and the Delaware District on the city's Westside, the majority of the Buffalo area's Jews now live in the northeastern suburbs. Buffalo's [[Jewish Community Center|Jewish Community centers]] are located in the Delaware District, North Buffalo and Amherst.

Distancing itself from its industrial past, Buffalo is redefining itself as a cultural, banking, [[education]]al, [[medicine|medical]] center and architectural tourism destination.

The New York Times has declared that Buffalo is one of the top cities in America for architecture. Approximately 80 sites are included on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Buffalo, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. All of the major American architects of the 19th and early 20th century built masterpieces in Buffalo, most of which are still standing. They include:

The country's largest intact parks system designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], including [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Delaware Park]]. Buffalo was the first city for which Olmsted designed (in 1869) an interconnected park and parkway system rather than stand-alone parks.

The [[Prudential (Guaranty) Building (Buffalo, New York)|Guaranty Building]], by [[Louis Sullivan]], was one of the first steel-supported, curtain-walled buildings in the world, and its 13 stories made it, at the time it was built (1895), the tallest building in Buffalo and one of the world's first true skyscrapers.<ref>[http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html Louis Sullivan - Guaranty / Prudential Building], accessed 7 July 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html | date=20070702045925 }}</ref> It is a [[National Historic Landmark]].

The Hotel Buffalo (originally the Statler Hotel) by August Esenwein and [[James A. Johnson (architect)|James A. Johnson]] was the first hotel in the world to feature a private bath in each room.

The [[H. H. Richardson Complex]], originally the New York State Asylum for the Insane, is [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] in style and was the largest commission designed by prominent architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. The grounds of this hospital were designed by Olmsted. Though currently in a state of disrepair, New York State has allocated funds to restore this treasure.

There are several buildings by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]], [[George Barton House]], [[William R. Heath House]], [[Walter V. Davidson House]], [[Graycliff|The Graycliff Estate]], as well as the now demolished [[Larkin Administration Building]].<ref>[http://ah.bfn.org/a/soldiers/76/ William Heath House], accessed 7 July 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://ah.bfn.org/a/soldiers/76/  | date=20071228212810 }}</ref><ref>[http://graycliff.bfn.org/ The Graycliff Estate].

[[Last call (bar term)|Last call]] is at 4&nbsp;a.m. in Buffalo, rather than 2&nbsp;a.m. as in most other areas of the U.S. This is often attributed to the historically high density of industrial facilities and the demand of second and third [[shift work|shift]] patrons. It is also because [[New York]] law allows bars to be open until 4&nbsp;a.m. (However, local municipalities can override it to an earlier time.)

Several distinct and thriving [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]] districts have grown around clusters of bars and nightclubs in the city. The most visible nightlife district is West Chippewa Street,<ref>[http://www.westchippewa.com/ Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo NightLife, chippewa street, west chippewa street, Chippewa Street, West Chippewa Street]</ref> located between Main Street and South Elmwood Avenue. The area is home to high-energy dance clubs, crowded bars, trendy coffeehouses, and restaurants. [[Allentown, Buffalo, New York|Allentown]], where bars are as numerous but the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed, is a several minute walk north to Allen Street. Allen Street near Main Street houses several bars, while Allen near Elmwood has many bars that feature live music. Continuing up Elmwood Avenue from Allentown is the Elmwood Strip, which runs about two miles (3&nbsp;km) to [[Buffalo State College]]. This strip has numerous small boutiques and restaurants, with few large corporate establishments. Crowds on this strip include everyone from college students to families to the elderly.

===Public festivals===
Like many large cities, numerous festivals have become part of the city's culture and tradition. Though most of the festivals occur during the summer months, the city has recently pushed efforts to have winter festivals as well in an effort to capitalize on the region's snowy reputation.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
Buffalo is served by the [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]], located in [[Cheektowaga]]. The airport, recently re-constructed, serves over 5 million passengers a year and is still growing. [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] ranks among the five cheapest airports from which to fly in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The average round trip flight cost is $295.58.<ref>{{cite news|title=Area flies high on low fares|author=Sharon Linstedt|work=[http://www.buffalonews.com/103/story/63037.html Buffalo News]|date=2007-04-24}} {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> In the last few years there has been a surge in Canadians flying out of Buffalo, mainly due to much cheaper tax and airline surcharges, as compared with Canadian airports and the ability to fly on some US based discount carriers not available in Canada (for example, [[JetBlue Airways]] and [[Southwest Airlines]]). As of 2006, plans are in the works by U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]] to make the under-used [[Niagara Falls International Airport]] into an international cargo hub for [[New York]] and [[Toronto]], as well as Canada as a whole.<ref>{{cite news|title=Niagara airport pushed as trade hub; Schumer joins effort to bring global cargo|author=Bill Michelmore|work=Buffalo News|page=B1|date=2006-06-26}}</ref>
[[File:Main Court Building, Buffalo.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] in downtown]]

===Public transit===
The [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] (NFTA) operates [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] and [[Niagara Falls International Airport]], and the [[public transport|public transit]] system throughout the Buffalo area. The [[NFTA]] operates bus lines throughout the city and suburbs, as well as the [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] transit system in the city.

The [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] is a {{convert|6.4|mi|km}} long, single line [[light rail]] system that extends from [[Erie Canal Harbor]] in downtown Buffalo to the [[University Heights, Buffalo, New York|University Heights]] district (specifically, the South Campus of [[University of Buffalo]]) in the northern part of the city. The downtown section of the line runs above ground and is free of charge to passengers. North of Theater Station, at the northern end of downtown, the line moves underground, remaining underground until it reaches the northern terminus of the line at University Heights. Passengers pay a fare to ride this section of the rail.

A new NFTA project is underway, often called "Cars on Main Street", that will substantially revise the downtown portion of the Metro Rail. It will allow vehicular traffic and Metro Rail cars to share Main St. in a manner similar to that of the trolleys of San Francisco. The design includes new stations and pedestrian-friendly improvements. The first phase of the project, restoring two way traffic on Main Street between Edward and West Tupper, was completed in 2009. When the entire project is complete in the next few years, the downtown portion of Main St. will be re-opened to vehicular traffic for the first time in almost 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Intercity rail===
Two train stations, [[Buffalo-Depew (Amtrak station)|Buffalo-Depew]] and [[Buffalo-Exchange Street Station|Buffalo-Exchange Street]] serve the city and are operated by [[Amtrak]].

Freight service for Buffalo is served by [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk Southern]] (NS), as well as [[Canadian National]] (CN) and [[Canadian Pacific]] (CP) railroads from across the Border. The area has 4 large rail yards: Frontier (CSX), Bison (NS), SK (NS / CP) and Buffalo Creek (NS / CSX). A large amount of hazardous cargo also crosses through the Buffalo area, such as liquid [[propane]] and [[anhydrous ammonia]].

===Waterways===
Buffalo is at the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], one of the [[Great Lakes]], which boasts the greatest variety of freshwater sportfish in the country. The Lake serves as a playground for numerous personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft, and provides a short water route to excellent sand beaches on the nearby [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]] (Canada) shore. The city has an extensive [[breakwall]] system protecting its inner and outer Lake Erie [[harbor]]s, which are maintained at commercial navigation depths for [[Great Lakes]] freighters.

A Lake Erie tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]], for which the city is named. Buffalo is historically linked to the fabled [[Erie Canal]], which ends where the [[Black Rock Channel]] enters [[Lake Erie]]. When the Canal was dedicated in 1825, its conceiver, New York State governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] took waters from Lake Erie at Buffalo's Western Terminus of the Canal (now the [[Commercial Slip]]). He sailed to New York City on the Canal packet ''[[Seneca Chief]]'', which later returned to Buffalo with Atlantic Ocean water. The seawater was poured into the Lake by Judge and future Buffalo Mayor [[Samuel Wilkeson]]. Once a major route for passengers and cargo, the Canal is now used primarily for pleasure craft and some light local freight, and in Buffalo it bypasses the swift upper reach of the [[Niagara River]]. A tributary of the Niagara River is [[Scajaquada Creek]], which flows though Buffalo, via the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed Delaware Lake and Park.

===National and state highway access===

==Federal offices==
===US Army Corps of Engineers===
The offices of the Buffalo District, [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] are located adjacent to the Black Rock Lock in the Black Rock channel of the [[Erie Canal]]. In addition to maintaining and operating the lock, the District is responsible for planning, design, construction and maintenance of water resources projects in an area extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]]. These include the [[Mount Morris Dam|flood-control dam]] at [[Mount Morris (town), New York|Mount Morris, New York]], oversight of the lower [[Great Lakes]] ([[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]]), review and permitting of wetlands construction, and remedial action for hazardous waste sites.
