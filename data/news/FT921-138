 POSEIDON Gold (PosGold), part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, suffered a setback yesterday when shareholders in Mount Leyshon Gold Mines rejected plans for a merger. Mount Leyshon, which is 49 per cent owned by PosGold, is one of two companies targeted by Mr de Crespigny for a merger which would have created Australia's third-largest gold producer. The board said more than half the company's shareholders voted for the merger, but the majority failed to reach the 75 per cent threshold required by the company's articles of association. Small shareholders are understood to have objected to the terms of the merger, under which PosGold offered nine of its shares, five options and ADollars 1.50 (USDollars 1.15) cash for every five Mount Leyshon shares. Shareholders in ACM Gold, the other target company, will vote on a separate merger proposal on Monday. ACM Gold is 40 per cent owned by Normandy Poseidon.

If the deal goes through, Normandy Poseidon will emerge with 55.2 per cent of the merged PosGold, and Anglo American, the South African mining group,
