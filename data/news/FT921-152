 COMPUTER PEOPLE, one of the UK's largest computer recruitment consultancies, suffered the full force of the recession in its key markets last year as clients in the US and the UK postponed projects and delayed taking on new staff. Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell 68 per cent to Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 3.11m) on revenues 11 per cent down at Pounds 67.7m. Earnings per share declined 67 per cent to 5.48p (16.42p) and a final dividend of 3.3p is proposed making a 5.4p (6.2p) total. Mr Rupert Bayfield, the chairman, said: 'This balances the actual level of earnings in 1991, a reasonable return for our shareholders and our policy of ensuring that we are prudently financed.' Net borrowings were lower than expected at Pounds 2.9m, with net gearing at 52 per cent. The group supplies permanent and temporary computer staff in the UK and temporary consultants in the US. It is therefore vulnerable to downturns in the computing services market, which is experiencing its worst ever recession. The share price, which topped 280p in the summer of 1990 and has been trading at under 100p recently, fell 5p to 90p on the results. Mr Bayfield said the management of the company had been streamlined and there had been a 20 per cent reduction in sales, support and administrative staff, equal to about 100 people. He did not anticipate further restructuring.
