 W&amp;A INVESTMENT Corporation, the diversified South African industrial and consumer group, weathered difficult operating conditions to record a 14 per cent increase in earnings in 1991. Turnover was 6 per cent higher than in 1990 at R3.2bn (Dollars 1.1bn), though the figures are not directly comparable. Attributable profits rose to R128.9m from R113.1m. Earnings per share declined, however, to 79 cents from 95 cents on account of a 37 per cent increase in the weighted number of permanent equity instruments in issue. The total dividend was unchanged at 42 cents per share. During the year, the group embarked on a number of important structural changes. These included selling property and shares in Elcentre, the manufacturer of power cables and distributor of electrical goods, as well as its Arwa/Burhose hosiery business for R200m. The debtors' book of furniture retailer, JD group, was also sold. Mr Jeff Liebesman, executive chairman, was pleased the group had maintained its operating margin at 10.4 per cent.
