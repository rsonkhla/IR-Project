 SAINT LOUIS, the French food and paper company which recently became embroiled in the bid battle for Perrier mineral water, yesterday announced a bigger dividend following a 3.2 per cent increase in net profits from FFr732m (Dollars 130.7m) in 1990 to FFr760m in 1991. The board proposed an increase in the dividend from FFr30 to FFr32 a share. Saint Louis became involved in the Perrier saga because of its links with the Agnelli family of Italy, one of its minority shareholders. Saint Louis agreed to buy 13.8 per cent of Perrier for FFr1.5bn on the eve of the announcement of the first FFr13.42bn bid from Nestle, the Swiss food group. This purchase was later annulled by the Paris commercial court and Saint Louis sold the shares back to Perrier. The Perrier fracas came at a time of a period of rapid expansion for Saint Louis, which last November launched a FFr4.3bn share offer for the remaining shares in Arjomari-Prioux, the paper company in which it already held a controlling 41.42 per cent stake. The group's net profits for 1991 comprised FFr527m from food interests and FFr232m from the paper division.
