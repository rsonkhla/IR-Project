 MR GIANNI AGNELLI, the Italian industrialist, has bought 5 per cent of Guoco Group - the owner of Dao Heng Bank, Hong Kong's fourth largest bank - from the Kuwait Investment Office. In what is believed to be Mr Agnelli's first foray into Far East markets, he said the purchase would lay the groundwork for future co-operation with Guoco and the Hong Leong group of companies, both of which are controlled by the Quek family of Malaysia. The family has extensive interests in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, as well as Hong Kong, mainly in finance, property and manufacturing which it holds through the Hong Leong group of companies. The family also owns 31 per cent of Guoco which at the weekend said it had bought 49 per cent of Hoare Govett Asia following a buyout of the broker by its management from Security Pacific. Aside from banking, Guoco also has interests in hotels and manufacturing in China. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but analysts said that Mr Agnelli would have had to pay at least HKDollars 190m (USDollars 24.5m) for the stake in Guoco. KIO will retain a 24 per cent interest in the company. Mr Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, has made a convertible loan to Guoco which entitles him to 9 per cent of the company's capital upon conversion.
