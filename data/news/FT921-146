 SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and materials maker, hopes to earn more in the current year than 1991's FFr2.51bn (Dollars 450m) net attributable profit, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman, Reuter reports. Mr Beffa, speaking to financial analysts, said the first signs of recovery in the US, where Saint-Gobain sees about 20 per cent of turnover, were apparent in February and confirmed in March. 'The extent of this recovery . . . cannot be predicted,' he said. 'It will be moderate in 1992 and more significant in 1993.' The US market is critical to Saint-Gobain because of its Dollars 1.9bn acquisition in 1990 of US abrasives and ceramics-maker Norton. Mr Beffa said German growth, which was strong in 1991, was expected to hold up well in 1992, while French business was likely to be stable this year. Saint-Gobain's FFr2.5bn net attributable profit for 1991 was down from FFr3.36bn in 1990. Mr Beffa added that Saint-Gobain expected to continue to reduce debt in 1992, although he said the company might not reach its goal of cutting net debt to 40 per cent of equity by the end of 1993. Net debt stood at FFr20.5bn, or 56 per cent of equity, at end-1991 against FFr19.4bn, or 59 per cent of equity, at the end of 1990.
