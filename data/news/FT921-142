 THE CHAIRMAN of the London-based Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is expected to retire soon and be replaced by a senior official from one of Kuwait's commercial banks, according to the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), the Nicosia-based oil industry weekly, AP-DJ reports from Manama. MEES said Mr Fahd Mohammed al-Sabah wanted to retire from the KIO for health reasons. He is likely be replaced by Mr Ali Rashid al-Badr, chairman of the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East. The KIO manages the bulk of Kuwait's overseas equity investments, which include significant stakes in British Petroleum, Midland Bank and Daimler-Benz.
