 A SHARP rise in underwriting losses at Cornhill Insurance pushed the company into the red last year, writes Richard Lapper. Cornhill, the UK subsidiary of Allianz, Europe's biggest insurer, reported a loss before tax of Pounds 39.5m in 1991, compared with a profit of Pounds 30.8m in the previous year. Nearly half the loss was incurred by the Legal Protection subsidiary which reported an insurance loss of Pounds 17.9m after increasing premium income by 4 per cent to Pounds 9.4m. Overall premiums from general insurance increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 595.2m (Pounds 504.4m) but underwriting losses rose to Pounds 102.1m (Pounds 39.5m). With investment marginally lower at Pounds 65.9m (Pounds 66.1m) the company reported a general insurance loss of Pounds 37.9m (compared with a profit of Pounds 26.4m). Life profits were slightly lower at Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 4m). Associated undertakings produced a loss of Pounds 5.5m (profit of Pounds 900,000). The group's solvency margin was down to 39.2 per cent. Cornhill sought to increase its share of general insurance business - currently about 3 per cent - by increasing premium income from motor and personal insurance by 24 per cent to Pounds 224.7m.
