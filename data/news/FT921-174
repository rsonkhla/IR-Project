 Maurice Dwek, the dominating presence at the struggling retail jewellers Owen &amp; Robinson, is relinquishing his role as chief executive after coming under pressure from institutional shareholders to appoint outside directors with strong retail experience. His position is to be filled by Alan Gaynor (right), who over the past 20 years has worked for various retailing companies including Asda, Do It All, and the Underwood chemists chain. Michael Smith, who spent 11 years at Laura Ashley, latterly as acting chief executive, has also been appointed to the O&amp;R board as finance director. The incoming pair will face a tough task restoring the company's fortunes. O&amp;R ran into financial problems last year as a result of a disastrous foray into the property market and issued a profits warning in January after the jewellery sector endured a poor Christmas. But Gaynor, who has spent the past 15 months developing 'pay and play' public golf courses for Carlton Golf, a company he helped to found, believes O&amp;R has the potential to recover strongly. He suggests much more can be done to market the company's 60-store chain of Gold Centres effectively. 'People see it is a local jeweller, not a national chain,' he says. Dwek remains as chairman of O&amp;R. Tom Forsyth, the current finance director, and Tony Shasha, property director, will resign from O&amp;R this week.
