 MR CHRISTER Zetterberg, chief executive of Volvo, plans to leave the Swedish car and truck group in October after barely two years at the helm. The 50-year-old former banker and forestry group chief executive - who until recently had been tipped as the heir-apparent to Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman - gave no indication of what he will do when he steps down. Volvo issued a brief statement yesterday announcing Mr Zetterberg's intention to leave in October. Only last week, Volvo confounded Sweden's closely-knit business community with the announcement it was replacing Mr Zetterberg with Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive of Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals group with which Volvo wants to merge. Volvo said Mr Gyll would take over as chief executive from May 13, while Mr Zetterberg would be demoted to the position of deputy chief executive. However, yesterday Volvo said Mr Zetterberg would remain with the company officially until October 1992 and would be 'available to help Volvo until then'. 'My decision to leave the company was quite natural in the light of the management shift', said Mr Zetterberg yesterday. Mr Zetterberg was not available for further comment. Business relations between Volvo and Procordia have clearly grown warmer as a result of the discussions about a proposed SKr38.7bn (Dollars 6.48bn) merger of their operations, although it is still not clear whether the government will allow the deal to go ahead. Mr Zetterberg joined Volvo as company president in the spring of 1990 before taking over from Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar as chief executive officer in October of the same year. He is credited with introducing important rationalisation measures, including the plan to cut 11,000 jobs and reduce costs by SKr5.5bn by the end of 1992. At the end of 1991, Volvo had 63,600 employees, and costs for the year amounted to SKr75.6bn.
