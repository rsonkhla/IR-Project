 VEBA, the German power-to-retailing conglomerate, yesterday reported record sales and profits for 1991. It promised shareholders a DM12 dividend, DM1 more than in 1990. Mr Klaus Piltz, chairman, said he was cautiously optimistic for this year, estimating that results would at least match those of 1991. He said all sectors except oil and chemicals were performing well. Consolidated turnover rose 9 per cent to DM59.5bn (Dollars 36bn) and operating profits were up 18.7 per cent at almost DM3bn, said Mr Ulrich Hartmann, finance director. The group, which comprises 674 subsidiaries compared with 646 at the end of 1990, had especially good results in electricity generation and distribution, and in the trading sector. Mr Piltz said fixed costs would be scrupulously examined this year following a flurry of acquisitions and new investments. The aim was to reduce costs by DM400m a year before the end of 1993. This would involve reducing the workforce by 3,500, slimming down administration, decentralising management, and pulling out of fringe activities. The chairman, responding to criticism of relatively weak growth in the share price, said the question of shareholder value was a legitimate issue. Higher share prices, however, could not be achieved through short-term measures. Veba's core businesses depended on medium and long-term strategies. There was no 'taboo' attached to floating off subsidiaries, but such action should be taken only when it served the financial and strategic interests of the group. Linde, the German engineering group, expects 1992 group sales to rise by about 10 per cent, after climbing 13.9 per cent in 1991 to DM6.91bn, Reuter reports from Wiesbaden.
