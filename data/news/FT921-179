 Denmark is attempting to set up a national network of libraries to promote business information on the model of a similar library network launched in the UK just over a year ago. The Danish initiative, led by the Aarhus Business Information Centre (BIC) could form the beginnings of a Europe-wide network, according to Nick Fox, chairman of the UK's Business Information Network (BIN). The UK network, launched in February 1991, has grown to more than 60 members. It comprises public, academic and national libraries pledged to providing business information.
