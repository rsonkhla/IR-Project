 A SWISS national has been arrested in Tehran on charges of illegal contacts with Iranian military personnel, the Iranian news agency IRNA said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia. It quoted a statement by the Tehran military prosecutor as saying Mr Hans Bohler was arrested on March 18 along with two Iranians described as a manager and a clerk in a trading company. Iran is at loggerheads with Switzerland over the arrest in Berne of a member of the Iranian embassy on suspicion of involvement in the murder last August of former Iranian prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar in Paris. The IRNA report, monitored in Nicosia, said the three were arrested on charges of 'illegal contacts with the personnel of the Iranian armed forces'. It said the case was under investigation but gave no other details.
