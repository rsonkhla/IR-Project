 A STRONG second half performance helped MB-Caradon, the building products, security printing and packaging group, report a 4.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 106.4m for 1991. The result was better than the market had expected and the shares rose 9p to 259p. There was no change at the earnings level, though, with a fully diluted figure of 15p. The dividend for the year is held at 8.5p with a recommended maintained final of 5.75p. At the half way stage pre-tax profits were down from Pounds 53.4m to Pounds 47.2m. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said that so far in 1992 the profitability of the group's managed businesses - building products and security printing - were showing 'a significant increase'. Group turnover in 1991 was 2.4 per cent lower at Pounds 679.2m but operating profits from the managed businesses rose 4.7 per cent to Pounds 93.7m. The group's 25.1 per cent stake in CMB Packaging, the large European company, contributed Pounds 31.8m to trading profits, the same as in 1990. Mr Jansen said the UK building products business had seen a 12 per cent volume fall, but had decided to hold prices and cut costs to improve efficiency. There was a 13 per cent reduction in employees to 900. Operating profits fell 9.1 per cent to Pounds 48m. By contrast European profits rose 45 per cent to Pounds 13.9m, with margins up from 9.6 to 12 per cent. Volumes rose by 14 per cent and prices added another 3 per cent. Mr Jansen said the German market was still strong, though there were signs of weakening in other areas. In the US the security printing business began to see the benefits of the merger between Clarke and ABS, acquired in 1989, in the second half after suffering a 17 per cent profit fall in the first half. For the year operating profits were up 17 per cent to Pounds 31.8m and margins rose from 16.5 to 20.1 per cent. The small UK cheque printing company made a loss. New management at CMB had changed the focus of the business, Mr Jansen said. However, the stake which is in MB-Caradon's balance sheet at Pounds 335m contributed only Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 5.7m) in dividend. The interest charge rose slightly to Pounds 20m (Pounds 19.6m) although the Pounds 149m rights issue money received in November saved Pounds 2.7m. An exceptional credit of Pounds 900,000 was the balance of a Pounds 8.9m insurance claim and an Pounds 8m loss on the sale of the group's loss-making Austrian boiler business. The cash flow statement showed a Pounds 3.3m inflow even before the rights proceeds. There were also Pounds 10m (Pounds 18m) of reorganisation costs which were set against provisions made at the time of the MB-Caradon merger. At the year end the balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 202m) and shareholders' funds were Pounds 483.2m (Pounds 299.7m). COMMENT MB-Caradon's performance to date is hard to fault in broad terms. And there is every reason to expect continued organic growth and greater efficiency. So there is the luxury of looking at the longer term strategy. MB-Caradon's enviable problem is that its substantial investments in non-core businesses  -the CMB stake and the US security printing company - are sufficiently interesting to make it a risk to sell and reinvest. But in the end MB-Caradon must use its undoubted financial strength to expand the core building products business. Meanwhile, on forecasts of Pounds 135m pre-tax the prospective p/e of 15.2 shows the market's faith in the group's ability not to disappoint.
