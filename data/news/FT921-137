 BANK LEUMI, Israel's second largest bank, yesterday announced a slide into losses in 1991 as a result of parliament-enforced provisions for the debt-ridden agricultural sector and the second year of heavy losses at its New York subsidiary. The bank reported a net loss of Shk78m (USDollars 34.2m) for 1991compared with a net profit in 1990 of Shk87m, confirming warnings from the Bank of Israel that a law recently passed by the Knesset legislating large write-offs for the country's Moshavim collective farms would sorely damage profitability at the main banks. Bank Leumi, with total assets at the end of 1991 of Shk67.5 bn, set aside a total of Shk394m for bad debts, of which Shk301m was accounted for by the strictures of the new law. It said that without the Moshavim provision the group would have shown a net profit of Shk77m. Another big factor in the retreat into the red, however, were continued losses at Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York, which has been hit hard for the past two years by real estate losses. It was forced to make provisions against bad debts of Dollars 101m in 1991. The picture was much less gloomy at Israel Discount Bank, the country's third-largest after Bank Hapoalim, which reports today, and Leumi. Only lightly exposed to agricultural debt, it announced a 24 per cent rise in net profits to Shk86.5m in 1991, compared to Shk69.9m the year before. Return on capital of 4.7 per cent was up from 3.9 per cent in 1991. Total income was up 16 per cent at Shk445.7m. Total assets at the end of the year were Shk39.4bn, down by 4.3 per cent. This year's bank results are of unusual interest because of the government's accelerating programme to sell off its majority shareholdings acquired in 1983 when it stepped in to rescue the banking system from a catastrophic share collapse. The shareholdings have not to date had commensurate control because of a preferential share structure, but a one-share, one-vote system will apply once the government holdings are sold off.
