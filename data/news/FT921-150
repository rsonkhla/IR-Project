 A SURPRISE bid worth IPounds 4.67m, or Pounds 4.36m, has been launched for Tuskar Resources, the Dublin-based exploration company, by Coplex Resources, the Australian exploration company. The 1-for-12 offer values each Tuskar share at I1.78p. Coplex shares closed in Australia on Friday at 45 cents. Tuskar's shares closed at I1.75p last night. The Tuskar board will consider whether to recommend the offer to shareholders, once it has been formally received. Tuskar's principal asset is its 90 per cent interest in the Rubiales oilfield in Colombia with estimated recoverable reserves of 100m barrels. Tuskar has completed three exploration wells to date, but lacks the financial resources to complete testing to declare the field commercial. Tuskar must drill two further wells to hold its licence beyond June 30 this year. In an interim statement last month Mr Neil O'Donoghue, Tuskar's chairman, said that commercial development of the field would require investment sufficient to produce oil at 25,000 barrels per day to offset high transport costs and the current low prices for the heavy crude which the field produces. He said: 'The required amount of funds cannot be raised at this time, and any attempt to do so would not even raise sufficient funds to complete the current work programme.' In Tuskar's rights issue last year 54 per cent of the shares were left with the underwriters.
