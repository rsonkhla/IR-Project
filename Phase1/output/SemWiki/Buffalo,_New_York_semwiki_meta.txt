<#SECTIONS>
Name origiwikibn $ In 1798, The Holland Land Company hired Theophile Cazenove of Philadelphia as its agent in the newly established hub for the area in nearby Batavia, NY.  Cazenove then hired Joseph Ellicott, to survey the area and establish a village next to Buffalo Creek. Ellicott decided to utilize the spoke pattern for his new village, which he called "New Amsterdam", and centered it around Niagara Square.  In 1800, residents of the small village decided they did not like the name "New Amsterdam" and decided it would be called "Buffalo".  In 1808, the name was officially changed and the Village of Buffalo had 25 residents at the time.Most popular accounts hold that the name "Buffalo" is a corruption of the French phrase ''beau fleuve,'' "beautiful river," a phrase said to have been exclaimed by French explorers upon seeing the Niagara River. This speculation, however, is contradicted by primary sources. French explorers actually referred to Buffalo Creek in print as ''Rivière aux Chevaux,'' "Horse River."Houghton, Frederick. The Name Buffalo. Buffalo, NY: Buffalo Historical Society Publications, v. 24, pp. 63–69 [Buffalo in 1825].'' Buffalo, NY: S. Ball, 1825 What ''is'' clear is that there were no bison in the area; that the settlement of Buffalo took its name from Buffalo River (New York)Buffalo Creek;[Encyclopedia Britannica: Buffalo, NY, USA] and that Buffalo Creek first appeared on a map in 1759–1760.Houghton, p. 63 Although the Beau Fleuve theory is the most appealing but least plausible theory among many, it is unlikely that Buffalo's true name origin can be conclusively established.
History $ File:Buffalo Panorama 1911.jpgthumbright300pxBuffalo Panorama 1911File:Passenger boats buffalo new york 1909.jpgthumbright300pxPassenger boats at Buffalo 1909File:Pan-American Exposition - Ethnology Building at Night.jpgthumbright175pxPan-American Exposition– Ethnology Building at NightPrior to the Iroquois occupation of the region, the region was settled by the Neutral Nation. Later, the Senecas of the Iroquois Confederacy conquered the Neutrals. In 1804, Joseph Ellicott, a principal agent of the Holland Land Company, designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes, and is one of the few radial street plans in the US. During the War of 1812, on December 30, 1813,[The Buffalonian][History of Buffalo] Buffalo was burned by British forces. On November 4, 1825 the Erie Canal was completed with Buffalo strategically positioned at the western end of the system. At the time, the population was about 2,400. The Erie Canal brought a surge in population and commerce which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832, with a population of about 10,000 people.The City of Buffalo has long been home to African-Americans. An example is the 1828 village directory which listed 59 "Names of Coloured" heads of families. In 1845, construction was begun on the Macedonia Baptist Church (Buffalo, New York)Macedonia Baptist Church (commonly called the ''Michigan Street Baptist Church''). This African-American church was an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. On February 12, 1974 the church was added to the List of Registered Historic Places in Erie County, New YorkNational Register of Historic Places. Abolitionist leaders such as William Wells Brown made their home in Buffalo. Buffalo was also a terminus point of the Underground Railroad with many fugitives crossing the Niagara River from Buffalo to Fort Erie, Ontario and freedom.During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo. Grain and commercial goods shipments led to repeated expansion of the harbor. In 1843, the world's first steam-powered grain elevator was constructed by local merchant Joseph Dart, Jr. and engineer Robert Dunbar. The "Dart Elevator" enabled faster unloading of lake freighters along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from lakers to canal boats and, later on, rail cars.Abraham Lincoln visited Buffalo on February 16, 1861 on his trip to accept the presidency of the United States. During his visit, he stayed at the American Hotel on Main Street between Eagle Street and Court Street.  The Civil War years saw an increase in the population of Buffalo which grew from 81,029 to 94,210 by 1865. In addition to sending many soldiers to the Union effort, Buffalo manufacturers supplied important war material. For example, the Niagara Steam Forge Works manufactured turret parts for the ironclad ship USS MonitorUSS ''Monitor''.File:Lafayette Square, Buffalo, NY.jpgthumbrightLafayette Square, BuffaloLafayette Square c. 1912File:Niagara Square, Buffalo, NY.jpgthumbrightNiagara Square c. 1912Grover Cleveland served as Sheriff of Erie County (1871–1873), and was Mayor of Buffalo in 1882. He was later Governor of New York (1883–1885), 22nd President of the United States (1885–1889) and 24th President (1893–1897).In May, 1896, the Ellicott Square Building opened. For the next 16 years, it was the largest office building in the world. It was named after the surveyor Joseph Ellicott.At the dawn of the 20th Century, local mills were among the first to benefit from hydroelectric power generated via the Niagara River. The city got the nickname ''City of Light'' at this time due to the widespread electric lighting.[Can Buffalo Ever Come Back?] from ''City Journal (New York)City Journal'' In 1881, Buffalo deployed the first electric street lights in the United States. It was also part of the automobile revolution, hosting the brass era car builders Pierce Arrow and the Seven Little Buffaloes (automobile company)Seven Little Buffaloes early in the century.Believe it, or not. Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.178. ''City of Light'' (1999) was the title of Buffalo native Lauren BelferLauren Belfer's historical novel set in 1901, which in turn engendered a listing of real versus fictional persons and places[The History of Buffalo] featured in her pages.President William McKinley was William McKinley assassinationshot and mortally wounded at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. He died in the city eight days later and Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic SiteWilcox Mansion as the 26th President of the United States.An international bridge, known as the Peace Bridge, linking Buffalo to Fort Erie, Ontario was opened in 1927. The Buffalo Central Terminal, a 17-story Art Deco style station designed by architects Fellheimer  deindustrialization; and the nation-wide trend of suburbanization; the city's economy began to deteriorate. Like much of the Rust Belt, Buffalo, which peaked at more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline by almost 50 percent as industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities.Like other rust belt cities such as Flint, Michigan, Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. $4 billion was spent in 2007 compared to a $50 million average for the previous ten years. New proposals and renovations are numerous, especially in the downtown core. As of 2008, the population has continued to decrease, despite the efforts of city officials. (See demographics section.)The economy today is stable and the city's prosperity has increased significantly in the 21st century with the opening of several new hotels catering to tourists visiting nearby Niagara Falls and a new entertainment district along Elmwood Avenue, along with the opening of factories manufacturing environmentally conscious products.
Geography and climate $ File:BuffaloAvgTemps.pngrightthumbBuffalo average temperatures
Geography $ Buffalo is located on the eastern end of Lake Erie, opposite Fort Erie, Ontario in Canada, and at the beginning of the Niagara River, which flows northward over Niagara Falls and into Lake Ontario.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  of it is land and  of it is water. The total area is 22.66% water.
Climate $ File:BuffInBloom.jpgthumbrightBuffalo in bloomFile:Blizzard of 1977.jpgthumbrightBlizzard of 1977Buffalo has a reputation for snowy winters, but it is rarely the snowiest city in New York State.[New York State Golden Snowball Awards.] The region experiences a fairly humid, humid continental climatecontinental-type climate, but with a definite maritime climatemaritime flavor due to strong modification from the Great Lakes (Köppen climate classification "Dfb"— uniform precipitation distribution). The transitional seasons are very brief in Buffalo and Western New York.Winters in Western New York are generally cold and snowstormsnowy, but are changeable and include frequent thaws and rain as well. Winters can also be quite long in Western New York, usually spanning from mid-November to mid-March. Snow covers the ground more often than not from late December into early March, but periods of bare ground are not uncommon. Over half of the annual snowfall comes from the lake effect snowlake effect process and is very localized. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air crosses the relatively warm lake waters and becomes saturated, creating clouds and precipitation (meteorology)precipitation downwind. Due to the prevailing winds, areas south of Buffalo receive much more lake effect snow than locations to the north. The lake snow machine starts as early as mid-November, peaks in December, then virtually shuts down after Lake Erie freezes in mid-to-late January. The most well-known snowstorm in Buffalo's history, the Blizzard of 1977Blizzard of '77, was not a lake effect snowstorm in Buffalo in the normal sense of that term (Lake Erie was frozen over at the time), but instead resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated both on land and on frozen Lake Erie. Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage as with the Lake Storm "Aphid"October 2006 storm.Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the Northeastern United StatesNortheast, but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush.[Buffalo's Climate]. ''National Weather Service''. Retrieved July 5, 2006. Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate humidity and temperature. It receives, on average, over 65% of possible sunshine in June, July and August. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact that Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off Lake Erie in summer that gently temper the warmest days. As a result, the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of  or more.[Weather.com. Record high of  was recorded in August 1948] Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs at night. The stabilizing effect of Lake Erie continues to inhibit thunderstorms and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July. August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence.source 2 = HKO (sun hours, 1961−1990), Weather.com (extreme temps) date=August 2010}}
Demographics $  page 36}}
City proper $ Like most formerly industrial cities of the Great Lakes region, Buffalo has experienced an economic depression brought about by the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States and its population has declined in every year since. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, is significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population is equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change.Although the trend is inconclusive at this time, current census estimates indicate the rate of population loss may be decelerating to a stable state. The 2008–2009 loss estimate is 50% less than the years prior, and is at less than 1% year-over-year loss. Whether this trend will continue will not be evident until next year's estimate.At the 2005–2007 American Community Survey Estimates, the city's population was 53.8% White (48.7% non-Hispanic White alone), 41.1% Black or African American, 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.0% Asian, 4.5% from some other race and 2.5% from two or more races. 8.3% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.[Census Bureau]At that time of the 2000 census there were 292,648 people, 122,720 households, and 67,005 familyfamilies residing in the city. The population density is 7,205.8 people per square mile (2,782.4/km²). There are 145,574 househousing units at an average density of 3,584.4 per square mile (1,384.1/km²). The Race (U.S. Census)racial makeup of the city is 54.43% White (U.S. Census)White, 37.23% African American, 0.77% Native American (U.S. Census)Native American, 1.40% Asian (U.S. Census)Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)Pacific Islander, 3.68% from other races, and 2.45% from two or more races. 7.54% of the population are Hispanics in the United StatesHispanic or Latino of any race. The top 5 largest ancestries include German AmericanGerman (13.6%), Irish AmericanIrish (12.2%), Italian AmericanItalian (11.7%), Polish AmericanPolish (11.7%), and English AmericanEnglish (4.0%).[Buffalo, New York (NY) Detailed Profile - relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders]There were 122,720 households out of which 28.6% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.6% are married couples living together, 22.3% have a female householder with no husband present, and 45.4% are non-families. 37.7% of all households are made up of individuals and 12.1% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.29 and the average family size is 3.07.In the city the population included 26.3% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 34 years. For every 100 females there are 88.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 83.5 males.The median household incomemedian income for a household in the city is $24,536, and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The per capita income for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.File:Buffalo NY historical population.pngleftthumbPopulation of Buffalo, 1830–2006Buffalo has very sizable populations of Irish AmericanIrish, Italian AmericanItalian, Polish AmericanPolish, German AmericanGerman, Jewish AmericanJewish, Greek AmericanGreek, Arab AmericanArab, African American, Indian AmericanIndian, and Puerto Rican AmericanPuerto Rican descent. Major ethnic neighborhoods still exist but they changed significantly in the second half of the 20th century. Traditionally, Polish-Americans were the predominant occupants of the East Side, Buffalo, New YorkEast Side, while Italian-Americans composed a close-knit neighborhood in the west side. The East Side, Buffalo, New YorkEast Side is now a predominantly African American neighborhood, while the West Side has become a melting pot of many ethnicities, with Latino culture being the strongest influence. Throughout the history of Buffalo, the neighborhoods collectively called the First Ward, as well as much of South Buffalo, have comprised almost entirely people of Irish descent. Recently, there has been an influx of inhabitants that are of Arab descent, mainly from Yemen, as the city's Muslim population has increased to approximately 3000 according to an estimate. Since the 1950s and 1960s, the greater portion of the Jewish population has moved to the suburban areas outside of the city, or to the city's upper West Side.

History $ Buffalo and the surrounding area were long involved in railroad commerce, steel manufacture, automobile production, aircraft/aerospace design and production, Great Lakes shipping, and grain storage. Most of these industries have left the city through the years. Major steel production no longer exists in the area, although several smaller steel mills remain in operation. For example, Gibraltar Industries, a leading manufacturer, processor, and distributor of steel products for the building, industrial, and vehicular markets is headquartered in Buffalo. As of the 1950 United States Census, Buffalo was the 15th largest city in the country, the nation's largest inland port (twelfth overall), second biggest rail center, sixth largest steel producer, and eighth largest manufacturer.The regional economy can now best be described as a mix of industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and service-oriented private sector companies. Instead of relying on a single industry or sector for its economic future, the region has taken a diversified approach that have the potential to create opportunities for growth and expansion in the 21st century.
Race $ On October 25, 2008 the United Nations released a report entitled "State of the World's Cities" in which the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area was specifically cited as having one of the worst rates of economic inequality in the world and that it was racially based. The report specifically stated "the report cited figures from western New York state, where 40 per cent of black, Hispanic and ethnically-mixed households earned less than $15,000 in 1999, as compared to 15 per cent of white households." [UN: Major inequality in US cities - Americas - Al Jazeera English] In addition, the United States Census department also released information placing the Buffalo-Niagara metro area, as the 8th most segregated area in America.[CensusScope - Segregation: Dissimilarity Indices]
Employment $ Overall, employment in Buffalo has shifted as its population has declined and manufacturing has left. Buffalo's 2005 unemployment rate was 6.6%, contrasted with New York State's 5.0% rate.[See Erie County] And from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006, Erie County had no net job growth, ranking it 271st among the 326 largest counties in the country.[BLS, Table 1. Covered establishments, employment, and wages in the 326 largest counties, fourth quarter 2006] Yet the area has recently seen an upswing in job growth as unemployment has dropped to only 4.9% in July 2007 from 5.2% in 2006 and 6.6% in 2005.[New York] The area's manufacturing jobs have continued to show the largest losses in jobs with over 17,000 fewer than at the start of 2006. Yet other sectors of the economy have outdistanced manufacturing and are seeing large increases. Educational and health services added over 30,400 jobs in 2006 and over 20,500 jobs have been added in the professional and business (mostly finance) arena.[''bizjournals.com'']
Life sciences $ Buffalo has increasingly become a center for bioinformatics and human genome research, including work by researchers at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New YorkUniversity at Buffalo and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. This consortium is known as the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. It also includes: Buffalo Hearing –- a firm based on research conducted at Roswell Park Cancer Institute by Dr. Norma Nowak enabling  the delivery of personalized medicine.
Banking $ Buffalo is the headquarters of M&T Bank, a large regional bank with assets over $79B (as of June 2011).https://HSBC Bank USA also has major operations in Buffalo (The sports arena, which hosts the Buffalo Sabres National Hockey LeagueNHL franchise, is named HSBC Arena (Buffalo)HSBC Arena). Other banks, such as Bank of America and KeyBank have corporate operations in Buffalo. Citigroup also has regional offices in Amherst, New YorkAmherst, Buffalo's largest suburb. Buffalo has also become a hub of the debt collection industry.First Niagara Bank recently moved its headquarters to downtown Buffalo from nearby Lockport (city), New YorkLockport.

The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was 1965 [Chester A. Kowal}.[In 1977, Democratic Mayor James D. Griffin was first elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the Conservative Party (New York)Conservative Party and the Right to Life Party, after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker Arthur Eve. Griffin switched political allegiance several times during his 14 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat Anthony M. Masiello (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on social conservatism, often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat Byron Brown was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%-27%) over Republican Party (United States)Republican Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform.This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. At the urging of New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority. Conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government were initiated the following year by Mayor Tony Masiello, but came to naught.

The city has an extensive breakwall system protecting its inner and outer Lake Erie harbors, which are maintained at commercial navigation depths for Great Lakes freighters.A Lake Erie tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the Buffalo River (New York)Buffalo River, for which the city is named. Buffalo is historically linked to the fabled Erie Canal, which ends where the Black Rock Channel enters Lake Erie. When the Canal was dedicated in 1825, its conceiver, New York State governor DeWitt Clinton took waters from Lake Erie at Buffalo's Western Terminus of the Canal (now the Commercial Slip). He sailed to New York City on the Canal packet ''Seneca Chief'', which later returned to Buffalo with Atlantic Ocean water. The seawater was poured into the Lake by Judge and future Buffalo Mayor Samuel Wilkeson. Once a major route for passengers and cargo, the Canal is now used primarily for pleasure craft and some light local freight, and in Buffalo it bypasses the swift upper reach of the Niagara River. A tributary of the Niagara River is Scajaquada Creek, which flows though Buffalo, via the Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Delaware Lake and Park.
