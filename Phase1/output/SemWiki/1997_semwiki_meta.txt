 Examples  $ The following table shows all available Unicode blackboard bold characters.The first column shows the letter as typically rendered by the ubiquitous LaTeX markup system. The second column shows the Unicode codepoint. The third column shows the symbol itself (which will only display correctly if your browser supports Unicode and has access to a suitable font). The fourth column describes known typical (but not universal) usage in mathematical texts.{ summary="Blackboard Bold Characters" class="wikitable"!Image:LaTeX  logo.svg48px\LaTeX!Unicode (Hex)!Symbol!Mathematics usage-\mathbb{A}U+1D538Represents affine space or the adele ringring of adeles. Sometimes represents the algebraic numbers, the algebraic closure of '''Q''' ( or , although '''Q''' is often used instead).  It may also represent the algebraic integers, an important subring of the algebraic numbers.-U+1D552-\mathbb{B}U+1D539Sometimes represents a ball (mathematics)ball, a boolean domain, or the Brauer group of a field.-U+1D553-\mathbb{C}U+2102Represents the complex numbers.-U+1D554-\mathbb{D}U+1D53BRepresents the unit (open) disk in the complex plane (for example as a model of the Hyperbolic geometryHyperbolic plane), or the decimal fractions (see number).-U+1D555-D\!\!\!\!DU+2145-d\!\!\!\!dU+2146May represent the differential (calculus)differential symbol.-\mathbb{E}U+1D53CRepresents the expected value of a random variable, or Euclidean space.-U+1D556-e\!\!eU+2147Sometimes used for the mathematical constant ''e (mathematical constant)e''.-\mathbb{F}U+1D53DRepresents a Field (mathematics)field.  Often used for finite fields, with a subscript to indicate the order.  Also represents a Hirzebruch surface or a free group, with a subset to indicate the number of generators (or generating set, if infinite).-U+1D557-\mathbb{G}U+1D53ERepresents a Grassmannian or a group (mathematics)group, especially an algebraic group.-U+1D558-\mathbb{H}U+210DRepresents the quaternions (the H stands for William Rowan HamiltonHamilton), or the upper half-plane, or hyperbolic space, or hyperhomology of a complex.-U+1D559-\mathbb{I}U+1D540-U+1D55A-i\!iU+2148Occasionally used for the imaginary unit.-\mathbb{J}U+1D541Sometimes represents the irrational numbers, '''R'''\'''Q''' ().-U+1D541-j\!\!jU+2149-\mathbb{K}U+1D542Represents a Field (mathematics)field. This is derived from the German languageGerman word ''KÃ¶rper'', which is German for field (literally, "body"; cf. the French term ''corps'').  May also be used to denote a compact space.-U+1D55C-\mathbb{L}U+1D543Represents the Lefschetz motive. See Motive (algebraic geometry)motives.-U+1D55D-\mathbb{M}U+1D544-U+1D55E-\mathbb{N}U+2115Represents the natural numbers. May or may not include 0 (number)zero.-U+1D55F-\mathbb{O}U+1D546Represents the octonions.-U+1D560-\mathbb{P}U+2119Represents projective space, the probability of an event, the prime numbers, a power set, the positive reals, the Irrational number#The set of all irrationalsirrational numbers, or a forcing (mathematics)forcing partially ordered set (poset).-U+1D561-\mathbb{Q}U+211ARepresents the rational numbers. (The Q stands for quotient.)-U+1D562-\mathbb{R}U+211DRepresents the real numbers.-U+1D563-\mathbb{S}U+1D54ARepresents the sedenions, or a sphere.-U+1D564-\mathbb{T}U+1D54BRepresents a torus, or the circle group or a Hecke algebra (Hecke denoted his operators as ''T''''n'' or ).-U+1D565-\mathbb{U}U+1D54C-U+1D566-\mathbb{V}U+1D54DRepresents a vector space.-U+1D567-\mathbb{W}U+1D54ERepresents the whole numbers (here in the sense of non-negative integers), which also are represented by ''N''0.-U+1D568-\mathbb{X}U+1D54FOccasionally used to denote an arbitrary metric space.-U+1D569-\mathbb{Y}U+1D550-U+1D56A-\mathbb{Z}U+2124Represents the integers. (The Z is for ''Zahlen'', which is German for "numbers".)-U+1D56B--U+213E-U+213D-U+213F-U+213C-U+2140--U+1D7D8-U+1D7D9Often represents, in set theory, the Greatest elementtop element  of a forcing partially ordered set (poset), or occasionally for the  identity matrix in a matrix ring.-U+1D7DA-U+1D7DB-U+1D7DC-U+1D7DD-U+1D7DE-U+1D7DF-U+1D7E0-U+1D7E1}A blackboard bold Greek letter mu (not found in Unicode) is sometimes used by number theorists and algebraic geometers (with a subscript ''n'') to designate the group (or more specifically group scheme) of ''n''-th roots of unity.
